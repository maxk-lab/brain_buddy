"""The production rollout contract for the admin portal is pinned, not assumed.

`BRAIN_BUDDY_FEATURE_FLAGS` and `BRAIN_BUDDY_ADMIN_OPERATOR_EMAILS` are
restaged from the deploy workflow on every release, so the workflow line — not
the code default and not a `flyctl secrets set` — is the authoritative
production state. Two properties therefore need a regression test rather than a
sentence: the operator allow-list is staged from its own dedicated secret,
never aliased to the smoke admin identity (PD-2), and the staged flag string
stays **rollback-compatible** while it rolls the portal out to the internal
operator (009-FR-013).

Rollback compatibility is the sharp edge, and it has already cut once. Fly
secrets are app-scoped and survive an image swap, so a secret staged by a
release is still pending when a rollback restores the captured image. That
image raises at startup on an unknown flag name — so staging a name it does
not know turns a rollback into a crash loop, and does the same if staging
itself partially succeeds and rollback then runs.

Deploy run 31775660872 proved this in production: it staged
`external_agent_relay=internal`, the candidate failed the public reachability
gate, and the automatic rollback restored an image that could not parse the
name. The allow-list pinned below is read from the *current* rollback target,
not from a source SHA and not from this tree.

That target has since moved on: the default-OFF baseline release made a 009
image the healthy current one, so both `admin_portal` and `external_agent_relay`
are now rollback-parseable. Parseable is not the same as authorized — only
`admin_portal` is being rolled out, and the relay stays omitted, which is the
OFF state every image agrees on.

`scripts/test_validate_trunk_delivery.py` proves the *validator* rejects a
workflow with either property removed; this proves the workflow the repository
actually ships still has them, and it runs inside the backend suite where the
requirement-coverage gate can see it.
