"""Durable jobs for the agent relay's background responsibilities (spec 026 PR-24).

``AgentObserver`` owns two things on a clock: the periodic observation pass and
the lookups that settle exchanges a restart interrupted. This module runs both
as ledger jobs so a lease, a fence and a bounded retry stand behind them
(026-FR-015) instead of a daemon thread. It adds no scheduler: the adapters only
describe their cadence, and PR-64 registers them and removes the thread.

Nothing about the A2A rules moves here. The adapters call the observer, which
calls the service, so lookup, backoff, suspension and adoption behave exactly as
before. What the job adds is authority and honesty about outcomes:

- **One owner.** Constructing an adapter calls ``delegate_scheduling`` on the
  observer, so its own thread can no longer start; its pass also refuses to run
  beside a live thread. Within a process, claiming a run is shared with the old
  path, so one run is never read twice at once.
- **Fence.** The body runs inside ``JobExecutionGate.executing``. The relay has
  no Task write port (026-FR-021: an AgentRun never edits its Task), so today
  that binding guards nothing it can reach; it makes a future or accidental Task
  write through ``serialized_write`` or Review fail once the lease is lost. The
  observation pass also stops starting reads when ``should_abandon`` turns true.
- **Uncertainty.** A lookup that leaves the exchange interrupted proves nothing
  about whether the agent received the message, so the job is
  ``reconciliation_required``, never a success and never an endless retry.
- **Following the user.** The uncertainty is also on the run, and the user
  settles it there with **Check again** or **Stop run**. Nothing tells the
  ledger, so a reconcile pass reads the run's local state and closes the parked
  lookup once the user has decided; it never looks anything up or retries,
  because a retry would be a background lookup the user's own check already
  owns (014-FR-010). A run still waiting on the user keeps its job parked.
