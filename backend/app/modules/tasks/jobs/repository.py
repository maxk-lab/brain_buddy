"""SQLite job ledger sharing the Tasks database (spec 026 PR-20).

Every mutation runs inside ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` on its own connection, so the
database write lock -- not a Python lock -- is what serializes claimers. That
makes the ledger safe across threads *and* processes: two workers can never both
hold the same job, and a result is accepted only under the fence issued by the
claim that produced it.

The ledger records and arbitrates; it runs no effect. Nothing in this module
knows about any particular maintenance responsibility.
