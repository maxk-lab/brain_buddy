"""Who gets a worker, when, and what a restart owes them.

The service knows what one exchange or observation *means*; this knows how many
may run at once, in whose order, and how soon. Keeping the two apart is what
lets the wire rules be tested without threads and the concurrency rules without
a socket.

Three separately bounded pools, not one, and the separation is a correctness
property rather than tuning. A held ``SendMessage`` occupies its worker for up
to the reply window; an observation is short but constant; and a cancel is what
*resolves* a held exchange on some runtimes, so a cancel queued behind the
exchanges it ends would wait out the entire window while the surface could not
tell pool saturation from an agent that simply ignores cancellation.

Nothing here decides what a run means. It schedules, it drains wakes, it makes
the call, and it hands the answer to the service — which is why a state machine
bug can never hide in a thread.
