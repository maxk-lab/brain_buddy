Sync Impact Report:
- Version change: 4.0.1 -> 5.0.0
- Why MAJOR: the sanctioned landing path changes incompatibly (ADR-0035, owner
  decision 2026-10-17, issues #513/#514). PR-less SHIP/SHOW landing through
  `scripts/submit_to_trunk.sh` and `trunk-candidate/<sha>` is retired; every
  change, SHIP, SHOW or ASK, lands as a pull request through the merge queue
  behind `Full CI` and `Docker Images`, and ASK additionally needs explicit
  recorded owner approval on the PR. The temporary ruleset intervention is gone.
  Exact-SHA CI, Ship/Show/Ask classification and the Fly release path are kept.

Prior Sync Impact Report (3.0.0), preserved:

# BrainBuddy Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Data Consent & Safety
Protect user trust by defaulting to local control, explicit consent, and reversible user authority before data leaves the device or becomes a durable side effect.
- AI, transcription, or other remote processing MUST require current user consent and configured provider credentials; requests without consent or required configuration MUST fail visibly instead of silently uploading or degrading.
- Voice brain dumps and voice-led Weekly Review MUST preserve the ADR-0002 operation contract: provisional model output stays in the operation workspace until explicit confirmation applies frozen actions through domain ports.
- Raw audio, transcripts, credentials, local file paths, content hashes usable as fingerprints, and real user data MUST NOT enter logs, metrics, committed fixtures, or PR evidence.
- Cloud persistence, external task routing, CRT promotion, destructive edits, and delete/undo behavior MUST be user-visible, idempotent where applicable, and auditable.

### II. Tested Delivery Across Stack
Changes ship with evidence for the affected behavior and material failure risks. This principle is the canonical testing policy for every agent, planner, template, and reviewer.
- Before implementation, state the expected observable result and material failure risks in the existing brief or spec. Derive test expectations from those accepted requirements, not from the implementation's current output.
- Inspect and run relevant existing checks first. Reuse them when sufficient; extend or add tests only for missing behavior/risk coverage or a binding acceptance requirement. Zero new tests is valid. Technical task, function, file, and layer counts do not determine test count; do not duplicate the same guarantee across layers without a distinct risk.
- Choose the least costly level that reliably detects the relevant failure: unit/property tests for pure rules, integration tests for boundaries and persistence, browser/device tests for interactions that require that environment. Preserve existing deterministic checks for behavior-preserving refactors.
- Use test-first for automatically reproducible bug fixes and new or unprotected predefined critical invariants, such as owner isolation, consent enforcement, durable state, and idempotency: observe a meaningful test failure before implementing the fix or new invariant. An existing failing test is sufficient; an already protected invariant needs no duplicate test or artificial failure. For other changes, choose implementation/test order by feedback cost, with necessary writer checks complete before candidate freeze. Record concrete reproduction/verification evidence when a bug cannot be tested deterministically; docs-only changes may use non-code checks.
- Cover applicable material failure modes for AI, persistence, voice, routing, and operations: invalid input, timeouts, consent denial, retries, cancellation, and partial failure. Preserve frozen acceptance requirements; amend them explicitly when the intended behavior changes. Never weaken assertions or change expected results merely to make a regression pass.
- During iteration, run affected checks. Run the full applicable required suite on the prepared candidate under ADR-0023, not after every technical task; repeat checks when subsequent changes, failures, or unresolved risks invalidate their evidence. Existing coverage/mutation thresholds, Allure taxonomy, exact-SHA CI, independent acceptance, and release/smoke gates remain binding.
- Keep test selection in the existing brief/plan and verification report: name reused checks and any necessary additions. Do not create a separate test inventory, approval step, or reporting gate for each change.

### III. Contract-First Interfaces
Shared contracts are the source of truth and cannot drift across tiers, agents, or planning artifacts.
- Backend schemas and API contracts MUST be updated before frontend/client code depends on changed shapes; breaking changes require migration notes and compatibility strategy.
- ADR-0001 module ownership and ADR-0002 async-operation contracts are binding until superseded by a new accepted decision record.
- Specs, plans, and tasks MUST reference real file paths and explicit contracts rather than vague placeholders once a feature moves past specification.
- APIs and client-visible failures MUST return actionable errors with correlation IDs that remain usable for retry and reporting.

### IV. Traceable & Actionable Observability
Every request, operation, route, and review action must be diagnosable without exposing user content.
- Backend responses MUST include `X-Correlation-ID`. Correlation and observability IDs are labels only and never authorization or idempotency inputs. Dedicated owner-scoped command IDs MAY identify an immutable command for durable deduplication under an accepted domain contract. No client-supplied ID grants authority; replay MUST recheck current authority and reject changed command content under the same ID. Entity IDs alone do not authorize upsert or replay beyond the accepted domain contract.
- Long-running capture, review, AI, import/export, and save flows MUST expose progress, retry state, cancellation state, and partial-failure evidence.
- Logs, metrics, and operation events MUST contain IDs, timings, coarse confidence/error bands, and stage names rather than raw user text or media.
- Debug/profiling hooks may exist in development, but production UX must remain clean and privacy-preserving.

### V. Responsive, Resilient, Mobile-First Experience
BrainBuddy vNext is optimized for fast capture and review from mobile-first voice workflows while preserving the existing responsive CRT canvas.
- The primary product loop is voice/text capture -> atomic items -> clarify/approve -> route or CRT candidate -> smart Weekly Review -> evidence/results. Feature specs MUST state how they affect this loop or declare no impact.
- Recording, upload, provisional transcript/candidate display, confirmation, cancellation, and resume behavior MUST tolerate mobile interruptions, offline windows, and UI closure per ADR-0002.
- Canvas interactions MUST remain perceptually responsive on approximately 200-node trees; regressions require remediation before release.
- Local drafts, operation checkpoints, and confirmed domain records MUST avoid data loss and warn before destructive navigation or side effects.

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow
GitHub Spec Kit is the mandatory full authoring workflow when any canonical ADR-0023 trigger applies: a significant new capability, a cross-surface contract change, a persistence/schema change, a materially changed workflow/state-machine boundary, or any ASK-class outcome. Eligible bounded SHIP/SHOW changes use ADR-0023's lightweight brief instead.
- When the full path applies, the canonical artifact flow is constitution -> `/speckit-specify` (what/why) -> `/speckit-clarify` -> `/speckit-design` (user-visible surfaces) -> `/speckit-plan` (how/architecture) -> `/speckit-review` -> `/speckit-checklist` -> `/speckit-tasks` -> `/speckit-analyze`. `/speckit-design` and the ADR-0011 `/speckit-review` gate are not optional additions to the upstream core: a plan MUST cite `design.md` when the feature has a user-visible surface, and implementation MUST NOT begin on a review verdict other than `approved` or `founder-accepted`. `docs/spec-kit-workflow.md` carries the full thirteen-stage path including the optional stage 0 assessment.
- Use the official `github/spec-kit` CLI pinned to the repository-documented version through isolated `uv tool`/`uvx`; do not install it into application backend/frontend environments.
- `specs/` contains the versioned Spec Kit artifacts. Implementation intent changes MUST amend the relevant spec/plan/tasks before product code proceeds.
- Generated `tasks.md` is portable planning input organized by user story, dependency, and concrete file path. It does not bypass isolated worktrees, Principle II's testing policy, ADR-0023's applicable independent gate, CI, landing, or release gates.
- Spec Kit is not an execution orchestrator for BrainBuddy. Implementation may be performed by a developer or standalone agent. An explicitly activated managed outcome may add a separate control-plane overlay without changing these repository-wide rules.

## Historical Spec Grandfathering
The repository contains pre-adoption specs and requirements that must remain readable without forcing unsafe regeneration.
- `specs/001-relation-linking-refactor/` is already a complete historical Spec Kit-style directory and remains valid.
- `specs/002-async-voice-workflows/` predates the Spec Kit adoption (ADR-0005) and is grandfathered with `spec.md` plus `acceptance-tests.md`; do not fabricate missing generated artifacts unless the feature is materially changed. The repository pin has moved twice since that adoption and is recorded in `docs/spec-kit-workflow.md`, not here.
- Historical `requirements/` documents are background context only where they conflict with ADR-0001, ADR-0002, the current constitution, or current specs.
- New `specs/[NNN-feature]/` directories after this adoption MUST include the documented minimum Spec Kit artifacts and pass the repository spec check.

## Operational Guardrails
Security, configuration, delivery, and release constraints apply to all work.
- Follow `.env.example` for environment setup; never hardcode secrets. Compose and Fly deployments MUST respect API key and session-auth controls.
- Backend data persists under `backend/data` with an LRU cache and optional volumes; after the cutover to the Rust server (ADR-0032) persistent data lives in managed PostgreSQL and object storage instead. Either way, treat stored data as sensitive and keep it out of version control.
- Frontend defaults to `/api`; remote stacks require explicit proxy/origin configuration that preserves cookies and same-origin behavior where expected.
- Verified CI on the exact landed SHA is the merge gate, and a pull request through the merge queue is the only way to land (ADR-0035). Work happens in isolated branches/worktrees; every change is classified Ship/Show/Ask under ADR-0008 (ASK scope narrowed by ADR-0030). Eligible SHIP and SHOW work uses ADR-0023's one risk-selected independent gate on the PR head, then lands through the merge queue, which moves `main` only to a merge-group commit that passed `Full CI` and `Docker Images`. ASK-class changes take the same path and enter the queue only after explicit recorded owner approval on the PR for its exact head SHA — see `AGENTS.md` and `docs/autonomous-delivery-runbook.md`. `main` deploys through the normal Fly release path in every case.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates
How features are specified, planned, implemented, reviewed, and released.
- Start work by inspecting `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, relevant accepted ADRs, and any existing feature artifacts. Create the full Spec Kit set only when ADR-0023's full-path triggers apply.
- Specs MUST define independently testable user stories, acceptance scenarios, edge cases, consent/privacy impact, observability impact, and success criteria.
- Plans MUST document architecture, contract changes, persistence ownership, test strategy, release/smoke validation, and any justified constitution complexity.
- Tasks MUST be grouped by independently shippable user story and include concrete file paths. Apply Principle II when selecting checks and their order; reference sufficient existing tests instead of generating new test tasks for each implementation task.
- The applicable independent gate MUST block on constitution compliance, ADR alignment, consent enforcement, contract alignment, affected-stack validation, observability, and performance/mobile resilience. Full-path reviews additionally block on Spec Kit artifact completeness.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes conflicting local practices and guides all reviews.
- Amendments require a documented proposal or PR rationale referencing affected principles, impact analysis, updated dependent templates/docs, and preserved history in this file.
- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for new principles/sections or materially expanded requirements, PATCH for clarifications.
- Compliance is checked by ADR-0023's risk-selected independent gate before SHIP/SHOW release and by the full review path for ineligible or ASK work; violations need documented justification plus a remediation plan and owner.
- Accepted ADRs under `docs/decisions/` may refine this constitution for their decision scope, but broad governance changes belong here.
