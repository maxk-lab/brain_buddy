# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

<!--
  BrainBuddy override: delivery gates. Upstream treats tasks.md as an
  execution script; here it is portable planning input that never bypasses
  isolated worktrees, Constitution Principle II testing, independent acceptance,
  ADR-0008 landing classification, or CI. Those gates are restated below and
  must survive any upstream refresh.
-->

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), design.md (required when the feature has a user-visible surface), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Delivery gates** (non-negotiable, regardless of who executes these tasks):
isolated worktree and feature branch; Constitution Principle II's testing policy;
Allure taxonomy on every product
test with the covering feature-qualified id (`NNN-FR-###`/`NNN-SC-###`) in
the test name or story; acceptance
graded by an agent that did not write the code; landing class decided by
`scripts/classify_path_risk.py` (ADR-0008); every change, SHIP, SHOW or ASK,
lands as a PR through the merge queue behind `Full CI` and `Docker Images`, and an
ASK-class PR enters the queue only after explicit recorded owner approval on the PR
for its exact head SHA (ADR-0035; see `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/autonomous-delivery-runbook.md`).

Before freeze, the implementation writer MUST produce a typed receipt using
`.specify/templates/pre-freeze-receipt.schema.json` and run
`python3 scripts/validate_pre_freeze_receipt.py <receipt> --sha <full-lowercase-sha>`.
<!-- BrainBuddy pre-freeze receipt contract: tasks. Preserve this section. -->
The receipt covers only writer-owned pre-freeze gates. Independent review, QA,
CI, landing, deploy, and production smoke remain post-freeze obligations under
ADR-0008 and must never be represented as writer PASS evidence.

**Tests**: Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and follow Principle II.
For each changed behavior, identify sufficient existing checks and any material
gaps in the story's independent verification criteria. Generate test tasks only
for necessary additions or extensions, at the least costly reliable level.
The examples below are alternatives, not a requirement to add tests at every
layer. Apply test-first ordering only where Principle II requires it.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Include consent enforcement, mobile/resilience handling, observability (correlation IDs, actionable errors/progress), release/smoke validation, and data-safety safeguards where relevant.

**Multiple PRs for one spec**: After `spec.md` and `plan.md` are approved, and
before implementation, any feature larger than one reviewable PR gets
PR-sized slices; obtain the human's agreement on boundaries. Add a
`## PR-срезы` section to this very `tasks.md` containing one fenced `json`
block with `schema_version` set to `brainbuddy-pr-slices/v2` and at least two
ordered `slices`. Each slice has a unique `id` (`PR-01`, `PR-02`), a
reviewable `outcome`, nonempty `tasks` (`T001`), `requirements` (`NNN-FR-001`
or `NNN-SC-001`), repository-relative write `paths`, runnable `tests`,
`acceptance` evidence, `depends_on` (previous slice ids, or `[]`), a
`budget` of `{"product_loc": <=400, "files": <=12}` (tests, docs and specs do
not count; exceed it only with an `oversize_reason`), and an `implementer`
(`feature-implementer`, or `mechanical-implementer` for pattern-following
work). Assign every checklist task **exactly once**; shared setup and polish
tasks also need an owner. Start with a contract slice so backend, web and iOS
slices can run in parallel against it. Do not split into a backend PR followed
by a frontend PR unless the first has an independently testable contract. Do
not claim the same write path in independent parallel slices.
`python3 scripts/check_spec_kit_specs.py` validates the section; approve it
before an implementation worker begins. It is a delivery boundary, not
authorization to merge or deploy.

A slice must stand on its own as a reviewable contract (or safely disabled
scaffold). Preserve one feature's spec/plan/tasks as the product contract;
record slice outcomes and exact test evidence in each PR, then run the full
feature acceptance after all dependent slices integrate.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit-tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (only necessary additions or extensions)

> Reuse sufficient existing checks. Use test-first only where Constitution Principle II requires it.

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (only necessary additions or extensions)

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (only necessary additions or extensions)

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Close a remaining material test gap identified under Principle II in [existing test file]
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Select/reuse checks and order testing under Constitution Principle II
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Run independent test work for User Story 1 together only if Principle II identifies both gaps:
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Apply Constitution Principle II; zero new tests is valid when existing checks suffice
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Generated tasks.md is portable planning input only. Do not use it to bypass
  isolated worktrees, Constitution Principle II testing, independent review,
  CI, landing, or release gates.
