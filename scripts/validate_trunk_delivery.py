"""Validate the verified-trunk serial landing and production deploy contract.

Companion to ``validate_ci_artifacts.py`` (which owns the general CI artifact
contract). This validator fails closed when the ADR-0008 guards are missing.

The central architectural invariant: candidate-controlled CI
(``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` runs from the pushed ref) must NEVER be able to
promote ``main``. It therefore must hold no write permission, push nothing,
and reference neither the landing identity nor the ``landing`` or
``production`` GitHub environments; it only runs the full required job set
(with skipped required jobs failing, never passing) for
``trunk-candidate/**`` refs.

Landing is owned exclusively by the DEFAULT-BRANCH release workflow
(``deploy-fly-production.yml``, consumed via ``workflow_run`` so the
definition always comes from ``main``): a ``land`` job with a READ-ONLY
token (``contents: read`` — no job anywhere holds GITHUB_TOKEN write) that
runs in the GitHub ``landing`` environment and authenticates its pushes with
the dedicated SSH deploy key secret ``TRUNK_LANDING_SSH_KEY`` (checked out
via ``ssh-key`` with ``persist-credentials: true``; the environment's branch
policy restricts the secret to ``main``, which candidate-controlled push CI
can never satisfy). It verifies a single fresh parent on the current
``origin/main``, re-runs the trusted ``origin/main`` copy of the path-risk
classifier over NUL-separated ``--no-renames`` changed paths, fast-forwards
the exact tested SHA with a plain (never force) push, best-effort deletes the
candidate ref, and — for EVERY consumed run, candidate and ``main`` alike —
proves ``origin/main`` equals the tested SHA. The ``deploy`` job needs the
landing proof, runs with ``contents: read`` in the ``production``
environment, re-verifies the exact main head before any Fly mutation, then
captures rollback images, verifies the smoke identity preflight, stages the
smoke identity, deploys, smokes, and rolls back verified, never masked.
No manual dispatch exists anywhere. Uses only the standard library so it can
run before any dependencies are installed.

#: the healthy release left by the default-OFF baseline deployment (run
#: 31798252344 for exact main d9ec122f, authenticated production smoke passed).
#: Built from the 009 revision, it parses `admin_portal` and
#: `external_agent_relay` too — unlike the pre-009 image that crash-looped on
#: `external_agent_relay` in deploy run 31775660872. Widen this only after a
#: successful deployment has made a newer, known-compatible image the captured
#: rollback target, as that baseline release did; agreeing with the candidate
#: tree instead is what caused the incident.
#:
#: This is a safety allow-list only. Parseable is not authorized — see
#: `AUTHORIZED_STAGED_FEATURE_FLAGS`.

#: omission is the OFF state every image agrees on. Changing this string is an
#: ASK-class rollout decision.
#:
#: ADR-0019 (2026-08-15): `voice_brain_dump`/`external_agent_relay` are now
#: managed live through the admin portal's SQLite store, and `admin_portal` no longer exists as a flag (DD-14, DD-15)
