# Design: Mac first run and sign-in

**Feature**: `specs/029-mac-first-run-sign-in/`
**Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md) (thread decisions 2026-10-16; (c) answered 2026-10-16:
Rust only; pending (a), (b))
**Screen source**: the "Carry On · first run" board page, version `1792138611-15e1`
(`DSOnboard.dc.html`), Mac cells **M01** Welcome, **M02** First capture, **M03** First
step, **M04** Landing, **M05** Sign in, **M06** Invite. No separate HTML mockup is
produced: the board cells are the approved renders, and every deviation is listed in
[Deviations from the board](#deviations-from-the-board).
**Human sign-off**: pending — Max to confirm this state inventory before
`/speckit-review`.

<!-- Ids are stable once written; never renumber. ADR-0006: the term is Tag. -->

## Applicability

Two surfaces in the existing main window and one sheet:

- **F-** ids: the first run inside the main window (Inbox welcome, inspector first step,
  Next actions landing, first-run sidebar).
- **A-** ids: the sign-in sheet (choice, code, password, outcomes, invite).

Reused unchanged: the capture field and mic button (`CarryOnMacCapture.swift`), the Mac
inspector panel (`CarryOnMacInspector.swift`), the next-step card and its "Done" / "Not
now" (spec 021 slices 2–3), the sidebar brand and footer (`SyncPresentation.swift:126`),
the password form, Advanced and errors of spec 021 X-03, and the account-deletion-cancelled
alert.

## Screen inventory

| id | surface | screen | board | FR refs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Main window › Inbox (empty, first run) | Welcome and first capture | M01, M02 | 029-FR-002 – 029-FR-007, 029-FR-014 |
| F-02 | Main window › Inbox list + inspector | First step | M03 | 029-FR-008 – 029-FR-010 |
| F-03 | Main window › Next actions | Landing with one tip | M04 | 029-FR-011 |
| F-04 | Main window › sidebar | First-run sidebar | M01–M04 | 029-FR-012 |
| A-01 | Sheet over the main window | Sign in or create an account | M05 | 029-FR-018, 029-FR-019, 029-FR-021, 029-FR-026 |
| A-02 | A-01 › Send me a code | Check your email | not drawn (iPhone copy) | 029-FR-020 |

| A-05 | A-01 after `INVITE_REQUIRED` | Enter your invite code | M06 | 029-FR-028 – 029-FR-030 |

## Layout (from the board)

- **Window**: 1280 × 800 reference; `bg-ground`; glass sidebar as today.
- **F-01 welcome block**: horizontally centred and top-anchored in the Inbox content column,
  max width 560 pt, with the board's 12 pt inset below the native toolbar. Mark +
  "Carry On" (serif 44), 28 pt gap, "What feels heaviest?" (serif 36, `text-primary`),
  12 pt gap, the instruction line (`text-secondary`, 15 pt), 24 pt gap, the capture field
  (white `surface-card` field, 44 pt high, focus ring `focus-ring` drawn outside the field,
  30 pt `voice-bg` mic button inside on the trailing edge), 20 pt gap, two hint rows (69 × 26 pt
  chip on `chip-bg` with the shortcut or the mic glyph, then `text-primary` text), 24 pt gap,
  the "No account needed" line (`text-secondary`).
- **M02 typed capture**: keep the 36 pt "What feels heaviest?" heading and the centred 560 pt
  block. Hide the brand, instruction, hints, no-account line, and mic button. The focused white
  `surface-card` field is 64 pt high. Four pt below it, put "Goes to Inbox, as you wrote it"
  (`text-secondary`) at left and "Return to add · Esc to skip" (`text-secondary`, 12 pt) at right.
- **F-02**: the Inbox list header "1 thing to sort"; the row selected (`surface-selected`).
  The inspector is the existing 380 pt panel: caption "Inbox · 1 of 1" (`text-secondary`),
  the item text (`text-primary`), "What is the first step you could take?" (serif 24),
  the step field (`surface-card`, focus ring), the helper line (`text-secondary`), then
  the action bar: "Make it my next step" (`button-primary-bg` / `-fg`, the accent; the only
  one) and "Not yet" (quiet).
- **F-03**: toolbar as today ("New step ⌘N", ⌘O). List header "Next actions · 1 step".
  The next-step card as today with label "Now" (no project). The tip under the card is one
  horizontal stone-quiet row: tip text (`text-primary`, 14 pt) at the leading edge and a plain
  trailing "Got it" action. It has no separate outlined card or secondary pill button.
- **F-04**: sidebar brand, then "Lists" (Inbox, Next actions, Waiting for, Someday) and
  "Dates" (Overdue, Today, Upcoming), rows without trailing counts; no Projects, Archived
  projects or Tags sections; footer "On this Mac · Sign in to sync" as today.
- **A-01**: sheet 440 pt wide, `surface-card`, 24 pt padding. Title "Sign in or create an
  account" (serif 24), the kept-tasks line (`text-secondary`), the provider button(s) drawn
  as their guidelines require (Google: white/neutral face with the Google mark; Apple per
  (a)), the "or" divider (`control-quiet` rules), the Email field (focused), "Send me a
  code" as drawn — an ink button, 32 pt tall, background `text-primary`, label
  `bg-ground`, full width beside "Cancel" (quiet) — then "Use a password instead" (quiet
  link) and "Advanced" (disclosure, existing).
- **A-05**: same sheet. "New account · <email>" caption (`text-secondary`), "Enter your
  invite code" (serif 24), the explanation (`text-secondary`), one monospaced code field
  (default per (b)), the keep-local line (`text-secondary`), then "Create account" (the
  same ink button as "Send me a code", not the accent) and "Back" (quiet).
- Colours are design-system roles only (`CarryOnColorStyle`), light and dark. The accent
  (`accent-fill`, terracotta) appears only on "Make it my next step" and the next-step
  card's mark, as on the board.

## Deviations from the board

| board element | 029 | reason |
|---|---|---|
| M04 card label "Garage · now" | "Now" | No project is created (thread T3); matches the iPhone cell |
| M05 "Continue with Apple" | hidden | Pending (a); recommended later (029-FR-026) |
| M06 six code cells in two groups | one field | Pending (b); codes are 43 characters |
| M05 caption "Target, not today …" | built now for Google, email, password; Google and email shown only when `methods` reports them for `macos` (Rust server); password only against the Python server (A-01.08) | Thread T5; Max's answer to (c), Rust only |
| Code step, outcomes, loading and error states | not drawn | A-02, A-04, A-01.01/.03/.06 with the iPhone's and 021's words |
| Password-only sheet | not drawn | A-01.08: M05's title and kept-tasks line over the 021 X-03 form, for a server that does not know `macos` ((c)) |
| "Not yet" landing, Esc on M01 | not drawn | F-02.06, F-01.07 |
| Dark appearance for M02–M06 | not drawn | Tokens' dark values |

## Affordance → requirement map

| affordance | state | requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Welcome field Return / Esc | F-01.02 – F-01.08 | 029-FR-006, 029-FR-007 |
| Mic button | F-01.05, F-01.06 | 029-FR-005 |
| Make it my next step / Not yet | F-02.01 – F-02.06 | 029-FR-009, 029-FR-010 |
| Got it | F-03.03 | 029-FR-011 |
| Footer "Sign in to sync" | F-04.01, A-01 | 029-FR-018 |
| Continue with Google | A-01.04, A-01.05 | 029-FR-021 |
| Send me a code / Verify / Resend | A-02 | 029-FR-020 |
| Use a password instead | A-03 | 029-FR-022 |
| Create account / Back | A-05 | 029-FR-029, 029-FR-030 |

Requirements with no affordance: 029-FR-001 (clean-Mac decision), 029-FR-013,
029-FR-014, 029-FR-015 (record), 029-FR-016 / 029-FR-017 (client value), 029-FR-027
(secrets), 029-FR-032, 029-FR-033.

## Keyboard and focus

- F-01: focus in the capture field on appear; Return adds; Esc skips; Tab reaches the mic
  button, then the sidebar footer's "Sign in to sync".
- F-02: focus moves to the step field when the question appears; Return = "Make it my
  next step" when enabled; Esc = "Not yet"; Tab order field → primary → Not yet.
- F-03: focus on "Got it" when the tip appears; Return or Space dismisses; the card's
  existing keyboard actions are unchanged.
- A-01: focus in the Email field (or the first offered button when email is not offered);
  Esc = Cancel; Return in Email = Send me a code.
- A-02: focus in the code field; Return verifies when 6 digits are entered.
- A-05: focus in the code field; Return = Create account when enabled; Esc = Back.
- VoiceOver: the hints read as "Shortcut, Control Option Shift B, Capture from any app …";
  the tip is announced once politely; errors are announced once.
- Focus ring: `focus-ring` role, visible in both appearances.

## Primary loop impact

The first run takes one item through capture → Inbox → clarify (first step) → Next
actions with existing commands. Weekly Review, CRT and evidence are unchanged.

## Mobile viability

Not applicable: macOS-only surfaces. The iPhone keeps its sign-in sheet; the iPhone's
first-run cells are not built here.
