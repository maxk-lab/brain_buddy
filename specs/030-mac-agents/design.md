# Design: Mac agents

**Feature**: `specs/030-mac-agents/`
**Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md) (Clarifications settled with Max: 2026-10-16; pending (a) –
(c) carry recommended defaults)
**Screen source**: Mac design board, version `1792138611-15e1` — cells **M21** (Hand off),
**M22** (Agent runs), **M23** (Needs you), **M24** (Result), **M29** (Agent details),
**M30** (Add agent), and the design-system page **DSAgents** ("Carry On · agents") for the
sidebar's per-agent rows, the run-state words and the colour rules. No separate HTML
mockup is produced: the cells are the approved renders, and every deviation is listed in
[Deviations from the board](#deviations-from-the-board).
**Human sign-off**: pending — Max to confirm this state inventory before
`/speckit-review`.

<!-- Ids are stable once written; never renumber. ADR-0006: the term is Tag. -->

## Applicability

New Mac UI in the main window (a sidebar section, a canvas, a Waiting for group, an
inspector section, a sheet) and in the 028 Settings window (the Agents tab content and its
sheets). Everything else is reused unchanged: the main window's sidebar, list and
inspector frames (021), the Settings window and tab bar (028 S-01), 028's flag-off Agents
content (028 S-03), and the sign-in-again path (021 X-03).

G- ids are this feature's agent surfaces. State keys combine screen id and suffix, for
example `G-05.03`.

## Screen inventory

| id | surface | screen | purpose | FR refs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G-01 | Main window › sidebar | Agents section | "All runs N", one row per agent; "Add new agent" on the canvas | 030-FR-001, 030-FR-004 |
| G-02 | Main window › canvas (from G-01) | All runs canvas | Every listed run grouped by what it needs (M22); per-agent filter | 030-FR-005 – 030-FR-008, 030-FR-011 |
| G-03 | Main window › Waiting for | Agents group | Runs above People (M23, M24) | 030-FR-009 – 030-FR-011 |
| G-04 | Main window › inspector › sheet | Hand to an agent | Choose agent, see what it gets, send (M21) | 030-FR-013 – 030-FR-018 |
| G-05 | Main window › inspector | Run section | Timeline and state block of the step's latest run (M23, M24) | 030-FR-019 – 030-FR-023 |
| G-06 | Settings › Agents | Agents tab | List with + / −, details, Test again, Replace credential…, Edit… (M29) | 030-FR-029, 030-FR-030, 030-FR-036, 030-FR-037 |
| G-07 | Settings › Agents › sheet | Add new agent | Name, Address, Credential, Current password (M30) | 030-FR-031, 030-FR-034, 030-FR-035 |
| G-08 | Settings › Agents › sheet | Replace credential, Edit, Delete | The other agent mutations (not drawn) | 030-FR-032 – 030-FR-035 |

## Layout (from the board)

- **Sidebar** (G-01, M22 and DSAgents): a section headed "Agents" between Lists and
  Dates, in the existing sidebar row style. Rows: "All runs" with the trailing count;
  each agent with its trailing count or status word ("Stale"). "Add new agent" is not in
  the sidebar: DSAgents draws it as a glass pill with + at the top right of the All runs
  canvas. Glyphs from `CarryOnMacIcons`, copied from the board's SVG: the agent-run glyph
  (rounded rect, two dots, antenna) for All runs and every agent row, and +.
- **All runs canvas** (G-02, M22): the canvas header pattern of the task lists — title
  "All runs", meta "5 runs", and the line "Every step you handed off, by what it needs
  from you." in `text-secondary`. Groups use the list's section header style ("Needs you ·
  1"). Rows use the existing task row frame: step title in `text-primary`, second line in
  13 pt meta: agent name, " · ", detail.
- **Waiting for** (G-03, M23): header meta "2 people, 4 agents"; section headers "Agents",
  then "People". Agent rows: step title; meta "Hermes · " followed by the compact state,
  whose word takes the state's colour role, and " · 4 min" in `text-secondary`.
- **Run section** (G-05, M23, M24): in the inspector under the step's fields; the
  project chip and agent name on top ("Garage · Hermes"), the step title, then the
  timeline as rows of state word (semibold) and "10:02 · Guaranteed single start" meta.
  The state block follows: "Hermes asks" + question on a `surface-card`; the reply field
  (`field-bg`); buttons in a row, primary first.
- **Hand-off sheet** (G-04, M21): a sheet attached to the main window, 460 pt wide. Title
  "Hand to an agent", the line under it, agent rows as selectable cards (selected card
  `surface-selected` with the focus treatment), "What it will get" label and a
  `surface-card` box with title, note and project lines, the disclosure line, then
  buttons "Send to Hermes" (`.carryOnPrimary`) and "Cancel" (`.carryOnSecondary`),
  right-aligned.
- **Agents tab** (G-06, M29): inside 028's Settings window; the approved PNG from PR #521
  is authoritative for this layout. Left, a borderless 220 pt agent list with agent icons,
  status dots and words, and a rounded `surface-card` selected row; circular secondary
  + and − controls sit at the bottom. Right, a separate full-height `surface-card` has the
  selected agent's serif title and status subtitle, then left-aligned 130 pt metadata
  labels and values, and the content-left Test again / Replace credential… / Edit… row
  (`.carryOnSecondary`). Long details scroll inside the card; read-only/offline notices
  remain accessible below the two columns. The existing Settings shell and G-06 states
  are unchanged (owner decision, 2026-10-17).
- **Add new agent** (G-07, M30): the authoritative PNG shows a 420 pt frosted sheet over
  Settings, using native regular material over `bg-ground`, with 22 pt padding, white
  `surface-card` fields and helpers in 12 pt
  `text-secondary`. The Credential label precedes a full-width stone two-segment control
  (Bearer token | API key), with a white selected segment; the secure secret field follows
  directly below it. Buttons are "Cancel" (quiet) and "Add and test" (`.carryOnStrong`,
  ink). The existing Current password field remains in this form, making it taller
  than the PNG. No separate password stage or credential workflow is introduced.
  Server proof, cancellation and secret-wiping contracts remain unchanged; other
  agent sheets retain their layout.
- **Colour** (DSAgents "Only your moves get colour"): Needs you uses `text-accent`
  (terracotta); Running and Queued `text-secondary` (dust); Lost contact
  `status-warning` (ochre); Failed `status-danger` (oxblood) with the agent's words.
  Every state is also in words. Only `CarryOnColorStyle` roles; the shared buttons
  `.carryOnPrimary`, `.carryOnSecondary`, `.carryOnQuiet`, `.carryOnStrong` and
  `CarryOnChip` for the project chip. No new colour or control is added to
  `BrainBuddyDesign`.

## Deviations from the board

| board element | 030 | reason |
|---|---|---|
| M21, M30: no password field | Current password where the server requires it (G-04.03, G-07.01, G-08) | Max, D2 |
| M21: "What it will get" title differs from the step ("Compare van hire prices" under "Call Sam about the van") | The manifest's title, which is the step's own title | The server sends the step's title; mock data differ |
| M21: no acknowledgement, no external-copy notice | Shown when the server returns them (G-04.04, G-04.02) | The server requires the acknowledgement; the notice is part of the manifest (spec 007) |
| M22: "Hermes · asks about card holds" | "Hermes · " + the question's first line | No server field summarises a question; nothing is invented |
| M23 and M29: Waiting for count 5 vs header "2 people, 4 agents"; M29/M30 show "Waiting for 3" and no Agents section | Count and header computed from the same rows: people + agents | Cells use different mock data |
| M23: Agents group omits the Queued and second Running runs that M22 lists | Waiting for's Agents group lists the same runs as All runs | One run set for both surfaces (D1) |
| States not drawn (Failed, Cancelled, Delivery unconfirmed, Sent, Accepted, Cancellation requested, Not sent, disconnected, expired, no longer reports) | Grouped per 030-FR-006 and shown verbatim | Pending (a) default |
| Hand-off entry not drawn ("A sheet from the step's card") | "Hand off…" in the inspector's action row | Smallest entry on the step's card |
| M29: − copy, Replace credential and Edit sheets not drawn | G-08 | Needed for real server actions; wording from the web and DSAgents ("Delete Hermes…") |
| Loading, offline, error, password-less, flag-off states | G-01.07, G-02.03 – G-02.06, G-04.05 – G-04.11, G-05.13, G-06.02 – G-06.08, G-07.02 – G-07.05 | Not drawn |

## Affordance → requirement map

| affordance | state | requirement |
|---|---|---|
| All runs / agent row / Add new agent (sidebar) | G-01.02 – G-01.06 | 030-FR-004, 030-FR-008 |

| Try again | G-02.06, G-04.07, G-06.07 | 030-FR-038 |

Requirements with no affordance: 030-FR-003 (no invented values), 030-FR-012 (steps never
changed by runs), 030-FR-024 (polling), 030-FR-026 (memory-only), 030-FR-027 (expiry),
030-FR-028 (inert text), 030-FR-035 (secrets), 030-FR-039 (logs), 030-FR-042 (boundaries).

## Keyboard and focus

- Sidebar: the Agents rows are in the sidebar's arrow-key order; Return opens.
- All runs and Waiting for: run rows take ↑/↓ like task rows; Return selects the step and
  moves focus to the inspector's run section.
- Hand-off sheet: focus starts on the selected agent row; ↑/↓ change the agent; Tab moves
  to the password field or acknowledgement when shown, then to Send; Return sends when
  enabled; Esc cancels.
- Run section: Tab reaches the reply field, Reply, Stop run, the Make the next step field,
  Mark step done, Hand off again; ⌘Return in the reply field sends the reply.
- Settings › Agents: the list takes ↑/↓; + and − are tab stops with names "Add agent" and
  "Delete agent"; sheets as above, with Esc cancelling and Delete never the default button.
- VoiceOver reads a run row as "Compare van hire prices, Hermes, Needs you"; a timeline row
  as "Running, 10:03, checked 6 firms"; states are words, never colour alone.
- Focus ring: `focus-ring` role in both appearances.

## Primary loop impact

Handing off is delegating: the step stays in its list (often Next actions) and its run
shows in Waiting for next to people, as the DSAgents page says. Capture, clarify/approve,
routing, CRT and evidence are unchanged. The Mac's weekly review row stays deferred
(spec 020), so runs do not appear in a review here.

## Mobile viability

Not applicable to this feature's screens (macOS only). The kit wrappers are
platform-neutral so the iPhone can build its own screens later.
