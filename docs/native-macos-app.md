# Brain Buddy for Mac (native app)

The Mac app in `macos/` is a SwiftUI app for macOS 26 (Swift 6.2, Swift 6 language mode). Since
spec 021 it is a client of the shared `BrainBuddyKit` package in `ios/BrainBuddyKit`, like the
iPhone app: the GTD rules (`GTDReducer`), the queries, Smart Add, the store file and the sync
engine are the kit's, so the two apps cannot drift. The Mac re-implements no rule. This page is
the Mac's counterpart of `docs/native-ios-app.md`; the runbook (build, test, dry run) is
`macos/README.md`, and the contracts are in `specs/021-mac-sync/contracts/` (`mac-app-host.md`
above all).

## How the app is put together

| part | where | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `BrainBuddyMacCore` | `macos/Sources/BrainBuddyMacCore/` | Foundation only, so it builds and tests outside the app: `mac-local.json`, the single-instance lock, `WorkspaceHost` and the launch (`MacLaunch`), the window's model, and the sync UI's logic (`SyncStatusLineModel`, `SyncPopoverModel`, `SignInFlow`, `SignOutFlow`, `SyncTriggerSource`, `MacPresentationRouter`, `MacSyncController`) |
| `BrainBuddyMac` | `macos/Sources/BrainBuddyMac/` | the SwiftUI and AppKit views that lay that logic out, the menus, `NWPathMonitor`, the App Nap activity, Apple speech recognition and the optional Whisper model inside the `VoiceTranscriber` actor, and the Whisper download in `WhisperDownload` (spec 037) |
| the kit | `ios/BrainBuddyKit` | `Workspace`, `SyncEngine`, `FileDocumentStore`, `KeychainSessionTokenStore`, the status describer and its copy |

Launch order (contracts/mac-app-host.md §1): the single-instance lock; the Rust runtime's
selection; `WorkspaceHost` (the kit `Workspace` over
`store.json`, a `SyncEngine` with the Mac's Keychain service, client identity and 30 s pull age);
`workspace.load()`; then the sync triggers start (`SyncTriggerSource`).

**One presenter.** Sync never interrupts. `MacPresentationRouter` is the only type that shows a
sheet, alert or popover or moves keyboard focus, and it takes only what the person did (a click, a
menu item, a shortcut, a launch notice), never a sync state. `MacPresentationGuardTests` reads the
app's sources and fails if a presentation or a focus move appears anywhere else, outside an
explicit allow-list of person-started surfaces (FR-017, SC-004).

## Files and their lifetimes

Everything lives in `~/Library/Application Support/BrainBuddyMac/` (0700), or in the folder
`BRAINBUDDY_MAC_DATA_DIR` names during a dry run. `docs/data-retention.md` has a row for each.

| file | lifetime |
|---|---|
| `store.json` (+ `.store.json.lock`) | the workspace: until sign-out deletes it; kept through a 401 ("Sign in again to sync"); account-less, until the person removes the folder |
| `store.unreadable-<UTC>.json` | a workspace file that could not be read, set aside after "Start fresh"; until sign-out |
| `mac-local.json` (+ lock) | review marks, the sidebar's disclosure, the first run; kept across sign-out |
| `local-gtd.json`, `local-gtd.backup-<UTC>.json`, `local-gtd.import-report-<UTC>.txt` | left by the retired pre-sync app and its one-time importer. The app no longer reads, creates or deletes them (the importer was removed under ADR-0030, with no real users); remove the folder to delete them |
| `.instance.lock` | one running copy per folder |

The 021 transport is ephemeral: no cookie jar, no HTTP cache.

## Signing in, the session token and the login keychain

Sign-in happens only in the sign-in sheet (design X-03). The kit stores the session token in the
person's **login keychain**, a generic password with service `app.brainbuddy.mac.session` and the
server's host as account (`<host>#1`, `#2`, … after a rebuild, below); pending logouts are kept under `app.brainbuddy.mac.session.pending-logout`
until they reach the server. The token is never written to a file or logged.

- **Not synchronizable.** The item is created with `kSecAttrSynchronizable = false`: it never goes
  to iCloud Keychain. No `kSecAttrAccessible` is set on macOS: the login keychain cannot deliver
  "this device only", so the store does not claim it.
- **Carried by Time Machine and Migration Assistant.** Unlike the iPhone's item, the login
  keychain is part of a Time Machine backup and moves with Migration Assistant, so a restored or
  migrated Mac can still hold the token. It stops working when its server session ends (30 days,
  sign-out elsewhere, account deletion), and a launch with no linked account removes any token
  left over.
- **Deleting the app does not remove it**: the login keychain belongs to the person. The next
  install's first launch with no linked account removes it.
- **No prompt during routine sync.** Every read by the sync engine and the launch cleanup is
  non-interactive: an item this build may not read gives "Sign in again to sync", never a system
  prompt. Every Keychain call runs on the engine actor, off the main actor. Only a sign-in the
  person started may let macOS ask for access.
- **A write that fails at sign-in** shows "Brain Buddy couldn't save your sign-in on this Mac. Try
  again." with a reference id; the session the server just opened is ended at once.
- **Cancel is decided once.** Cancel and Esc work while "Signing in…" waits for the server's reply:
  nothing is linked, the typed values stay and the session the server opened is ended. The kit
  decides Cancel against the link exactly once, just before it writes the link. After that Cancel
  and Esc are disabled, the sheet keeps reading "Signing in…" while the first sync runs, and it
  closes signed in, so a sign-in that stuck is never reported as cancelled.
- **One sign-in at a time.** While the sheet is shown or its request is on its way, a second
  "Sign in…" does nothing and the app menu's "Sign in…" and "Sign in again…" are disabled. After
  Cancel the typed values are back, but "Sign in" stays disabled until the cancelled request has
  ended.
- **Sign-in and sign-out never overlap.** While the sheet is open "Sign out…" does nothing and is
  disabled in the app menu; while a confirmed sign-out runs the sign-in items are disabled.

### "Sign in again" after a rebuild

An ad-hoc signed build (`build_app.sh`) is a new client of the Keychain item each time it is
rebuilt. On the login keychain only the app that created an item may read it without asking or
delete it, so the rebuilt app can do neither: routine sync stops and the footer reads **"Sign in
again to sync"**; nothing is lost, and changes wait on the Mac. Choose "Sign in again" (the email
and server are locked to the account). The app never asks for access to the old item and never
writes into it: it saves the new session as a new item next to it, account `<host>#1` (then
`#2`, … after later rebuilds), and always uses the item with the highest number. No access prompt
appears; macOS may still ask you to unlock the login keychain if it is locked.

The earlier build's item stays in the login keychain, unread and unused; the app cannot delete it,
and the server session it holds ends when it expires (30 days). Signing out removes this build's
items only. To tidy up, open **Keychain Access**, search for `app.brainbuddy.mac.session` and
delete the items you no longer need (and any `app.brainbuddy.mac.session.pending-logout` items,
which hold sessions an earlier build signed out of while offline). If the sheet ever shows
"couldn't save sign-in", do the same, then sign in again.

## Sync in the background

The Mac syncs only while it runs (no login item, no agent). Triggers (contracts/mac-app-host.md §5):

- launch, and activation of the app: one pull;
- the window becoming visible again after being hidden or covered: one pull;
- a local change: the kit's 2 s debounce;
- the network coming back: a cycle;
- the kit's 15 s tick, for the life of the process: a cycle only when the last pull is 30 s old or
  changes wait, and never during a scheduled retry, so an idle tick sends nothing;
- File › "Sync now" (⌘R), the popover's "Sync now" and the footer's "Retry": single-flight;
- resigning and quitting: the workspace's last write is flushed before the app exits; quitting also
  waits for a confirmed sign-out's removal of the account's data (not for the server logout, which
  is sent at the next launch if not now).

An open task's detail is read again on every 15 s tick, because subtasks and comments written
elsewhere reach this Mac only that way.

**App Nap.** macOS stretches the timers of an app that is hidden or covered. While an account is
linked, the app holds a `ProcessInfo` activity (`.userInitiatedAllowingIdleSystemSleep`, "Keeping
Brain Buddy in sync"), so a change made on the web or the iPhone appears within about a minute
even when the window is covered; it ends at sign-out, and an account-less Mac holds none. The cost
is accepted: an idle tick sends nothing, and a full pull runs at most every 30 s.

**Nothing is sent before sign-in.** Account-less, every trigger reaches the engine, which sends
nothing but a pending logout: one left by a sign-out, to its own host and carrying no task
data.

## The first sign-in and its timestamp limit

The first sign-in adds this Mac's tasks to the account: projects and tags with the same name
become one, and tasks are never merged by title. The server stamps creation, completion,
cancellation and waiting-since times itself, so after the first sign-in, tasks completed on the
Mac before the upgrade show the **upload day** as their completion date in History, and a Waiting
task's age, a created date and a cancelled date restart at the upload day, as the iPhone's
account-less upload does. Order, due dates and every other field are kept, and the review marks in
`mac-local.json` do not depend on these times. Keeping the original times would need the server to
accept client times, which is out of scope.

## Sign-out

"Sign out…" (popover or app menu) first runs the window's discard confirmation when a task edit is
unsaved or the capture draft is not empty, then the confirmation with the count of changes that
would be removed and the open sync issues. "Sign out and remove" removes
only the changes and sync issues the confirmation named (each by id and content). If any other change is
pending when you confirm, whether one that arrived while it was open, one queued in place of a
change that was just sent, or an edit folded into a named change, nothing is signed out or removed
and it shows again with the real count. While the sign-out runs, edits are refused ("Brain Buddy is
signing out. This wasn't saved; try again in a moment."): Quick Capture and the main window keep
what you typed, and it can be saved once you are signed out. The kit records the session as
a pending logout, removes this Mac's copy of the account's data, and only then removes the token
and ends the server session (now, or when the network is back); if the removal fails, nothing is
removed and the person is still signed in ("Couldn't sign out"). Review marks are kept.
As delivered 2026-10-08 (owner decision), the confirmation also names the weekly-review form text typed on
this Mac and not saved, which sign-out removes with the rest ("1 unsaved weekly-review draft will also be
removed from this Mac."); drafts alone change neither its title nor its "Sign out" button.

## The dry run

`BRAINBUDDY_MAC_DATA_DIR=<an existing folder>` runs the app on a copy of a folder (quickstart
Scenario 6 step 0): every file of the table above lives there, and the app makes no Keychain call at all (no read, write or removal) until a
sign-in the person starts in the dry run. Never sign in during a dry run of real data. See
`macos/README.md` for the commands.
