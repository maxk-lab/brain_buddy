# BrainBuddy Spec Kit workflow

BrainBuddy uses the official GitHub Spec Kit as the mandatory full authoring workflow
when any canonical ADR-0023 trigger applies: a significant new capability, a cross-
surface contract change, a persistence/schema change, a materially changed workflow/
state-machine boundary, or any ASK-class outcome. ADR-0023's lightweight brief replaces
the full campaign for an eligible bounded SHIP/SHOW correction, refactor, docs/test
change, or single-surface enhancement.

- Spec Kit version: `github/spec-kit` `v1.0.11`
- Installed integration: upstream `generic` (bring your own agent), skills under
  `.specify/agent-commands/`. This is a portable command source, not automatic
  discovery by every agent. Read the skill files directly or configure the
  chosen agent to discover them. No Claude/Codex executable is required to
  author the spec; the planning-review runtime has separate requirements below.
- Scope: feature specification and planning artifacts under `specs/`, plus the
  BrainBuddy-local stages that bracket them — business intake, design, the
  portable spec review gate (ADR-0011), acceptance and the delivery report
- Non-scope: CI, merge, release, or deploy

Spec Kit artifacts are portable and do not require Hermes. Outcomes explicitly
enrolled in the optional Hermes managed-delivery mode additionally follow
ADR-0010 and `docs/spec-driven-kanban.md`; that overlay does not apply to ordinary
developer or standalone-agent work.

## Install and verify prerequisites

Use isolated uv tooling. Do not install Spec Kit with pip inside the application
backend/frontend environments.

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@v1.0.11
specify version
specify integration status
specify integration list
```

Expected version output:

```text
CLI Version    1.0.11
```

The `generic` integration does not require a vendor CLI. `specify check` may
report absent agent executables without invalidating the installed templates.
For a one-off check without changing a user-scoped installation, use `uvx`:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@v1.0.11 specify version
```

## Refreshing Spec Kit in this repository

This repository is refreshed from the official pinned release with the
manifest-aware upgrade path:

```bash
specify integration status --json
specify integration upgrade generic --integration-options="--commands-dir .specify/agent-commands --skills"
# If reviewed extensions are installed, update each pinned extension explicitly:
# specify extension update <extension-id>
```

Do not run an unscoped `specify extension update`: extensions have independent
versions and require their own source review. Update each pinned extension
explicitly by id.

### Extension policy

`specify extension search` returns ~150 entries, but the shape of that catalog
matters more than its size:

| catalog | count | installable |
|---|---|---|
| `default` (all `spec-kit-core`) | 4 | yes |
| `community` | ~146 | **no — discovery only** |

The community catalog cannot be installed from. Adopting one of its entries
means adding a custom catalog (`.specify/extension-catalogs.yml`) or installing
from a third-party repository, each requiring its own source review and version
pin. None is BrainBuddy-aware: our review lenses cite the constitution,
ADR-0006 vocabulary, the Allure taxonomy and `classify_path_risk.py`, and a
generic extension knows none of that.

Decisions on the four installable extensions:

- **`assess` — INSTALLED.** Stage 0 of the pipeline: intake → research →
  define → shape → decide, writing
  `.specify/assessments/<slug>/decision.md` with a
  `go / needs-clarification / kill` verdict. It supplies the one capability the
  hand-built pipeline lacked — closing an idea *before* requirements are
  elicited. `/speckit-interview` reads that verdict and refuses to proceed on a
  `kill`, which is what makes the gate load-bearing.
  It is **not** registered under `hooks` in `.specify/extensions.yml`, and the
  reason recorded here until `.agents/` was removed — no Codex twin — is now
  void. What stands: stage 0 is optional by design, a mandatory hook would
  charge every small change for a five-stage assessment, the `kill` gate
  already works through `/speckit-interview` reading `decision.md`, and
  `assess` is five commands rather than one command a hook could name.

- **`git` — NOT INSTALLED**, and the reason is specific rather than blanket.
  It provides five commands; the extension installs all or none:
  `speckit.git.commit` auto-commits after each Spec Kit command, which fills
  the PR branch with per-stage commits that the merge queue's merge commit
  then carries into `main`'s history (ADR-0035). `speckit.git.feature` duplicates
  `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh` and fights worktree ownership.
  `speckit.git.initialize` is irrelevant here. The two read-only commands
  (`speckit.git.validate`, `speckit.git.remote`) are harmless but add nothing:
  branch naming is already a repository convention and remote detection is
  already done by `speckit-taskstoissues`.

- **`agent-context` — NOT INSTALLED.** It manages `CLAUDE.md` with generated
  plan references and markers. `CLAUDE.md` here is hand-maintained and
  authoritative; a generator editing it would fight every manual change.

- **`bug` — not installed, but not rejected.** Bug triage under
  `.specify/bugs/<slug>/` is outside the feature-delivery pipeline. Worth
  revisiting on its own merits.

**`specify extension add` rewrites `.specify/extensions.yml` and strips its
comments.** After any install, restore the header from git history — it
documents the hook contract and why `assess` stays unhooked.

`.specify/extensions.yml` is **not** a third-party extension install. It is
first-party repository configuration that the ten v1.0.11 skills already read:
each checks `hooks.before_<stage>` and `hooks.after_<stage>` and, for a
mandatory hook, emits `EXECUTE_COMMAND` and waits. Chaining the BrainBuddy
stages through it is what lets intake, design, review, acceptance and report
attach to the standard flow **without forking a single upstream skill body**.
It adds no new runtime, no scheduler, and no upstream dependency. Review it
like product code; it is not covered by the extension prohibition above.

Before a forced integration refresh, preserve every file in the
preserved-overrides table below. Restore them after the refresh, inspect
`git diff`, and accept only understood project-specific overrides. The current
refresh installs v1.0.11 shared assets and generic skills under `.specify/`.

### Preserved overrides

`specify integration upgrade generic --force` overwrites installed assets with
upstream content, silently reverting each of these. Nothing used to verify them
afterwards, so a refresh could quietly undo a policy decision.
`scripts/check_speckit_manifests.py` now guards them — each file carries a
marker string that upstream cannot contain — and runs in `make check-specs`.

| file | why it diverges from upstream |
|---|---|
| `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` | consent/local-first and mobile-first callouts required by the constitution |
| `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` | real repository source tree; Constitution Check including the requirement to cite `design.md` |
| `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` | delivery gates restated: worktree, Constitution Principle II testing, independent acceptance, ADR-0008 landing |
| `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` | BrainBuddy constitution gates |
| `.specify/agent-commands/speckit-implement/SKILL.md` | implements one explicitly selected PR slice from `tasks.md` under BrainBuddy's worktree and quality gates |
| `.specify/agent-commands/speckit-tasks/SKILL.md` | applies Constitution Principle II to test tasks; obtains approval of PR-sized task boundaries before implementation |

Run `python3 scripts/check_speckit_manifests.py --list` to see the markers.

After any future refresh:

1. Inspect `git diff` before accepting changes.
2. Preserve `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and project-specific template gates.
3. Confirm `.specify/init-options.json` keeps `speckit_version` at the intended
   version and `integration: generic` with portable skills under
   `.specify/agent-commands/`.
4. Confirm project-specific templates remain portable and planning-focused.
5. Run `python3 scripts/check_spec_kit_specs.py`.
6. Run any affected backend/frontend checks before opening a PR.

## Canonical feature-spec path

Use this path for every BrainBuddy outcome that meets ADR-0023's full-path triggers.
An eligible fast-lane change records its accepted outcome, non-goals, acceptance
evidence, and untouched scope instead. If it changes intent already frozen in an
existing feature spec, amend that spec before implementation.

For a full-path feature:

1. Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and relevant ADRs under
   `docs/decisions/`. `CLAUDE.md` is an optional runtime-specific companion.
2. Use `/speckit-constitution` only when governance principles or dependent
   templates need a real amendment.
3. Use `/speckit-specify` to create or update the feature's `spec.md` with the
   what and why. Do not include implementation design here except as constraints.
4. Use `/speckit-clarify` to resolve ambiguous requirements before planning.
5. Use `/speckit-plan` to describe architecture, module ownership, contracts,
   tests, data handling, observability, mobile/resilience, and release gates.
6. Use `/speckit-checklist` after planning. Under the pinned workflow,
   checklist setup requires `plan.md`; do not run checklist as a pre-plan command.
7. Use `/speckit-tasks` to generate logical implementation tasks grouped by
   independently testable user story, then run `/speckit-analyze`.
8. Implement directly from the validated artifacts with `/speckit-implement`,
   or, when explicitly enrolled, apply the optional managed-outcome overlay
   from `docs/spec-driven-kanban.md`.
9. Amend spec/plan/tasks and rerun affected validation whenever
    implementation intent changes.

### Multiple PRs for one feature spec

The approved `spec.md`, `plan.md` and `tasks.md` remain one product contract;
the **unit of coding/review is a PR slice**, not the whole spec. Any feature
larger than one reviewable PR gets a slice map: `/speckit-tasks` proposes the
slice boundaries **before** implementation and gets human approval. Record them
under `## PR-срезы` in `specs/NNN-<slug>/tasks.md` as one fenced JSON map:

````markdown
## PR-срезы

```json
{
  "schema_version": "brainbuddy-pr-slices/v2",
  "slices": [
    {"id": "PR-01", "outcome": "The shared contract is frozen behind a flag",
     "tasks": ["T001", "T002"], "requirements": ["NNN-FR-001"],
     "paths": ["backend/app/example.py", "backend/tests/test_example.py"],
     "depends_on": [], "tests": ["pytest backend/tests/test_example.py"],
     "acceptance": ["First journey contract is independently testable"],
     "budget": {"product_loc": 250, "files": 5},
     "implementer": "feature-implementer"},
    {"id": "PR-02", "outcome": "The web journey consumes that contract",
     "tasks": ["T003"], "requirements": ["NNN-FR-002"],

     "depends_on": ["PR-01"], "tests": ["npm run test -- example"],
     "acceptance": ["Second journey works against the accepted contract"],
     "budget": {"product_loc": 300, "files": 6},

  ]
}
```
````

Replace `NNN` and paths with real values; `PR-01` is a slice ID, not a
GitHub PR number. Every task belongs to exactly one slice; each slice has a
verifiable outcome, FR/SC coverage, owned write paths, checks,
dependency/base, a size `budget` and an `implementer` role. The budget caps a
slice at 400 product lines and 12 product files (tests, docs and specs do not
count) unless the slice states an `oversize_reason`;
`scripts/check_slice_budget.py` measures a branch against it. The historical
`brainbuddy-pr-slices/v1` maps (features 020 and 021) stay valid without a
budget. `python3 scripts/check_spec_kit_specs.py` rejects
missing/duplicate tasks, unknown requirements, forward dependencies and
parallel slices with overlapping paths. Human approval of the boundaries and
actual CI/review are separate from this structural check. If the section is
present, `/speckit-implement` requires one explicit `PR-NN` selector and must
not consume the entire `tasks.md` by default.

Shape the map for parallel work: a contract slice first (schema, types,
fixtures, a flag defaulting off), then backend, web and iOS slices that consume
it independently, each small enough to review in one sitting. Pattern-following
slices (renames, fixtures, tests against a frozen contract, docs) name
`mechanical-implementer` (Haiku); the rest name `feature-implementer` (Sonnet).

`/speckit-implement all` runs the conductor mode in
`.specify/agent-commands/speckit-implement/SKILL.md`: the planning session
launches one worker per ready slice **in parallel**, then the next wave as
dependencies merge, and routes long logs through `ci-log-triage` (Haiku).

Give each slice a fresh task/session, branch and worktree. Open one PR for that
slice only; its description names the shared spec, slice ID, requirement IDs,
base/dependency PR, exact SHA and tests. Verify that PR's diff, independent
review and CI before moving to a dependent slice. Independent slices may run
in parallel only with disjoint write paths **and** ports, databases and test
artifacts. Maintain a compact ledger: slice → owner → branch/worktree → PR →
SHA → CI → review → next action. Do not paste full build logs into the parent
session. After all slices are integrated, run full feature acceptance and
trace each FR/SC to the PR evidence. A PR is not authorization to merge or
deploy: every slice PR lands through the merge queue behind `Full CI` and
`Docker Images`, and an ASK-class slice enters the queue only after explicit
recorded owner approval on the PR (ADR-0035).

### BrainBuddy stages around the Spec Kit core

`.specify/extensions.yml` chains five local stages onto the flow above. The
full path for a feature that starts from an abstract ask:

```text
/speckit-interview   business requirements from the human -> intake.md
/speckit-specify     what and why -> spec.md
/speckit-clarify     disambiguate
/speckit-design      screens + numbered state inventory -> design.md   [human sign-off]
/speckit-plan        how and architecture -> plan.md  (MUST cite design.md)
/speckit-review      five-lens review gate (ADR-0011) -> verdict
/speckit-checklist   requirements quality
/speckit-tasks       -> tasks.md
/speckit-analyze     cross-artifact consistency
/speckit-implement   direct implementation via an isolated worktree
/speckit-accept      criterion -> test traceability -> accept | reject
/speckit-report      the end-to-end report for the human
```

Human-in-the-loop gates: the interview, clarification, design sign-off, any
product decision raised by review, ASK-class landing, and the final report.

### The review gate

`/speckit-review` is the single front door; do not invoke
`scripts/spec_kit_planning_review.py` ad hoc. ADR-0011 governs it.

**Risk classes** (ADR-0012): `low | medium | high`. The preflight may only
**raise** the class. An ASK-class surface derives `high`, which additionally
requires a recorded human sign-off; everything else derives nothing and the
campaign runs at the declared class, defaulting to `medium`. `low` is an
operator declaration and is never derived — at review time there is no diff, so
the classifier only sees which paths are *mentioned*, and a mention is not a
change. Unknown risk is `medium`, never `low`: treating silence as safety would
let exactly the work nobody could classify take the cheapest path. Risk
escalates and never de-escalates.

High-risk sign-off is not a flag the campaign caller sets. It is a record at
`.specify/workflows/runs/<run-id>/human-signoff.json` naming the approver and
bound to both the run id and a digest of the reviewed artifacts, so it cannot
be replayed into another campaign and goes stale when the spec is edited.

**Aggregation rule**, in order:

1. Any configured lens produced no review → `escalated`. Missing mandatory
   evidence never resolves to a pass, and it is checked first.
2. Any `product_decisions`, or any reviewer verdict of
   `product-decision-required` → `product-decision-required`. Needs the human.
3. Any reviewer verdict of `changes-required`, or any `blocking` finding →
   `technical-changes-required`.
4. Risk `high` with no recorded human sign-off → `escalated`.
5. Otherwise → `approved`.

A reviewer's verdict is gate-blocking on its own; the aggregator does not
re-derive it from finding severities. A malformed review still raises — absence
and corruption are different.

**Panel independence.** The default Codex panel is single-provider and
correlated (ADR-0024). The report must show that limitation. A custom adapter's
provider/model labels are claims, not attestation of independent providers;
its executable is measured against a caller-pinned SHA-256 but the model identity
remains unverified. Never present an external panel as proven independent.

**Campaign cap: two.** Fresh reviewer sessions re-litigate artifacts from
scratch, so finding counts diverge between runs even as every verified defect
is fixed. Carry campaign 1's findings forward into campaign 2. After campaign
2: land the fixes, defer the residue into explicit open lanes, or close by
founder acceptance with the full record (see below).

**Agent-neutral reviewer adapter.** The default legacy route uses the Codex CLI
(ADR-0024). To run without it, provide a reviewed, executable adapter pinned
by SHA-256. It reads the prompt on stdin and returns one schema-valid review
JSON object on stdout, with no diagnostic text there:

```bash
sha256sum /absolute/path/to/read-only-review-adapter
python3 scripts/spec_kit_planning_review.py review \
  --run-id "<run-id>" --role "<role>" \
  --reviewer-command "/absolute/path/to/read-only-review-adapter" \
  --adapter-sha256 "<the reviewed executable's 64-character hash>" \
  --provider "<claimed provider>" --model "<claimed model>"
```

The command must be **one executable without arguments**; for scripts, pin
the executable script itself rather than an interpreter with a mutable script
argument. The harness rejects hash mismatches before execution, passes only a
small environment allowlist, validates the JSON, and stamps the measured hash,
resolved path, current artifact digest and claimed provider/model. The artifact
digest must match the preflight snapshot both before and after execution; a
changed spec discards that review. The adapter
must independently enforce read-only behavior; the subprocess is **not** an OS
sandbox, and a pinned executable does not prove the remote model's identity.
External lenses are always marked degraded and `external-unverified`; their
claimed providers do not count as verified independent evidence. Their
provenance still has to pass the fail-closed summary validation. An installed
reviewer that fails is a hard error; no alternate runtime silently takes over.
Missing lenses escalate, and a partial campaign can never appear approved.

The canonical skills use hyphenated names under `.specify/agent-commands/`.
Invoke or read each using the active agent's own skill mechanism; the `/` names
below are identifiers, **not** a promise that every agent registers slash
commands automatically:

```text
/speckit-constitution
/speckit-interview
/speckit-specify
/speckit-clarify
/speckit-design
/speckit-plan
/speckit-review
/speckit-checklist
/speckit-tasks
/speckit-analyze
/speckit-implement
/speckit-accept
/speckit-report
```

This is the BrainBuddy full pipeline, including the local interview, design,
review, acceptance and report stages. Upstream v1.0.11 also supplies
`speckit-converge` for post-implementation reconciliation; run it when
implementation and tasks disagree, before final acceptance.

`assess` is not in the list because it is not hooked and is invoked as
`/speckit-assess-intake` and its four successors; see stage 0 above.

Every hooked command in `.specify/extensions.yml` must resolve to a SKILL.md
under `.specify/agent-commands/`; the agent must load the referenced file and
execute the mandatory stage before continuing.
`scripts/test_check_speckit_manifests.py` enforces that.

The three planning-review rubrics are plain markdown under
`.specify/review-rubrics/`; agents read the same files irrespective of their
runtime. Other legacy agent files remain optional tooling, not Spec Kit
integration requirements.

The generated artifacts do not prescribe a specific agent runtime. Standalone
Claude Code, other agents, or a developer may implement them while preserving
repository quality and release gates.

## Optional managed-outcome overlay

When an outcome is explicitly activated under ADR-0010, follow
`docs/spec-driven-kanban.md`. That runbook adds the requirements panel,
ratification, managed task metadata, signed lanes, canonical evidence, and
Hermes reconciliation for that outcome only. Do not infer managed mode from the
presence of plugin files or a Hermes installation.

## Artifact minimum for new specs

New non-grandfathered directories under `specs/` must use
`NNN-kebab-case-feature` naming and include at least:

```text
intake.md                    # /speckit-interview
spec.md                      # /speckit-specify
checklists/requirements.md   # /speckit-checklist
design.md                    # /speckit-design (a no-UI feature says so in two lines)
plan.md                      # /speckit-plan
tasks.md                     # /speckit-tasks
```

Once every task in `tasks.md` is checked off, the feature counts as delivered
and must additionally carry:

```text
acceptance.md        # /speckit-accept — explicit accept | reject verdict
traceability.md      # criterion -> named test matrix
report.md            # /speckit-report
```

Those three are deliberately **not** required at planning time. Demanding an
acceptance verdict for work that does not exist yet would force an agent to
fabricate one, which is worse than not requiring it.
`scripts/check_spec_kit_specs.py` reads delivery mechanically off `tasks.md`:
no unchecked `- [ ]` task lines left, and at least one ticked box.

Additional Spec Kit artifacts such as `research.md`, `data-model.md`,
`quickstart.md`, and `contracts/` should be present when the feature needs them.
Run the deterministic check before opening a PR:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_spec_kit_specs.py
# or
make check-specs
```

The repository check validates the durable, portable Spec Kit minimum. If a
legacy `hermes-handoff.json` is present it still validates that historical
contract. Managed outcomes have additional runtime validation defined by their
separate runbook.

## Legacy founder acceptance

This section applies only to historical `hermes-handoff.json` packages. It does
not alter the separate gates of an explicitly managed outcome.

A historical high-risk planning-review campaign was a bounded quality tool, not an oracle:
fresh reviewer sessions re-litigate artifacts from scratch, and on a large,
actively-amended package the blocking-finding count may diverge across
campaigns even as every verified defect is fixed. When the repo owner judges
that the loop has stopped converging, the review may be closed by explicit
founder acceptance: `planning_review.status: founder-accepted`, carrying a
`founder_acceptance` record with `accepted_by`, `accepted_on`, a substantive
`rationale`, and the complete `campaign_history` (every run id and its true
status). The validators accept this status only with that full record — it
documents more than an approval does, never less. Findings that motivated
fixes must be fixed or tracked in open handoff lanes before acceptance;
fabricating an `approved` status remains prohibited. First recorded use:
spec 005 (2026-07-29), five campaigns, nine product decisions, every verified
defect fixed, closed by the founder for a single-user deployment.

## Historical grandfathering

Existing history is preserved rather than regenerated blindly.

- `specs/001-relation-linking-refactor/` and
  `specs/003-smart-add-classification/` contain complete pre-ADR-0009 Spec Kit
  packages. Their normative planning files are hash-pinned and remain valid
  without a fabricated `hermes-handoff.json`; any material change invalidates
  that grandfathering and requires the current workflow.
- `specs/002-async-voice-workflows/` began before the initial v0.12.17
  adoption and was materially completed before ADR-0009 with acceptance,
  checklist, plan, tasks, and readiness evidence. Its current normative package
  is hash-pinned; a later material change requires the current handoff workflow.
- `specs/004-verified-trunk-delivery/` is likewise a complete pre-ADR-0009
  package with a hash-pinned planning baseline.
- `requirements/` remains historical context. Where it conflicts with the
  current constitution, ADRs, auth docs, live schemas, or `specs/`, the latter
  sources win.

## Boundary with execution tooling

Spec Kit generates and maintains portable planning artifacts. Developers and
standalone agents may execute them directly. For an explicitly managed outcome,
Hermes Kanban and `spec-driven-kanban` provide the optional durable task,
dependency, retry, and evidence runtime described in ADR-0010.

Generated `tasks.md` is planning input only. It is not permission to bypass:

- assigned ownership and agreed scope;
- isolated worktrees and branch discipline;
- [Constitution Principle II's testing policy](../.specify/memory/constitution.md#ii-tested-delivery-across-stack), including reuse and test-first applicability;
- independent review and `review-required` handoffs;
- CI, merge, and Fly release gates.

Spec changes should be committed and reviewed like product code changes.
