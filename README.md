Brain Buddy is a personal GTD workspace whose product focus is helping people turn loosely expressed intentions into executable next actions. It is built first for its owner's everyday use, then for people with similar needs.

The intended core loop is **capture → clarify into an executable next action → act personally or delegate → inspect the result → weekly review of what got stuck**. During review, AI helps identify why work stalled and clarify, resize, defer, or otherwise resolve it. Task detail should fit the person, executor, and situation; more subtasks are not automatically better.

Personal usefulness, learning, and a demonstrable body of work are the project's current goals. Open-source publication is under consideration; a large commercial business is not required for success.

See [Product direction: executable next actions](docs/product-direction.md) for the owner's goals, behavioral hypothesis, garage example, and roles of weekly review and agents. This is product direction, not a claim that the full loop is implemented; the feature specs and release evidence track delivery.

## Highlights
- **Interactive canvas** powered by React Flow with undo/redo, optimistic updates, and large-graph tuning for 200+ nodes.
- **GTD task tracker** with inbox/next/waiting/someday lists, due dates, projects, tags, and voice brain-dump capture that drafts tasks from speech.
- **FastAPI backend** persisting trees on the filesystem with version history snapshots; task data lives in SQLite (`tasks.sqlite3`) under the same data dir.
- **AI validation pipeline** with provider abstraction and mock provider for offline workflows.
- **Operational polish** including correlation-ID tracing, optional API key guardrails, and expanded troubleshooting guides.
- **Data safety by default** with 5s local autosave, exit warnings, and explicit consent gating before any AI request.

## Architecture Snapshot
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, pytest. Data persisted under `backend/data/` with schema versioning. See `docs/architecture_overview.md`.
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Zustand, React Query. Canvas profiling hook surfaces render timings during dev.
- **Data contracts**: Shared JSON payloads defined in `backend/app/schemas` and referenced by the React client.
- **Native iOS**: offline-first SwiftUI app for iOS 26 under `ios/`; CI builds and tests it (the `ios-kit` and `ios-app` lanes), and `.github/workflows/ios.yml` uploads `main` to TestFlight once signing is configured. See `ios/README.md` and `docs/native-ios-app.md`.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.14 with the `venv` module (see `.python-version`)
- Node.js 20.19.0 for the web frontend (see `frontend/.nvmrc`)
- nvm available to the shell, npm, and GNU Make
- Rust (via `rustup`, the version pinned in `rust/rust-toolchain.toml`) and a C compiler:
  installing the backend compiles the shared Rust core bridge (`bb_core`, feature 026)

For a reproducible host setup, runtime selection, and verification commands,
see [Local development](docs/runbooks/local-deployment.md).

### Install dependencies

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv backend/.venv
source backend/.venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e 'backend[dev]'

cd frontend
nvm use
npm ci
cd ..
```

### Run

In one terminal from the repository root:

```bash
source backend/.venv/bin/activate
make dev-backend
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
nvm use
npm run dev
```

In dev, Vite proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000` so the frontend and backend appear same-origin (required for cookie-based sessions).

### Accounts & invites
Signup is invite-gated. To create an invite:

```bash
# local dev
cd backend && python -m app.cli create-invite

# compose
docker compose exec backend python -m app.cli create-invite
```

Hand the printed code to whoever should sign up. They go to `/signup`, enter their email, a ≥12-character password, and the invite code. See `docs/auth.md` for the security model.

### Autosave & AI Consent
- The canvas autosaves locally every ~5s (debounced) and warns on exit if unsaved changes exist.
- AI feedback requires an explicit consent toggle in the inspector; decline consent to keep data local and receive a validation error instead of sending content.
- Failures return correlation IDs in error toasts so you can retry or report with context.

### Smoke Test via Docker Compose

Prefer containers for manual verification or stakeholder demos? Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The backend will listen on `http://localhost:8000`, and the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. When finished, tear everything down with `docker compose down --volumes`. See `docs/deployment_smoke.md` for the full runbook, including optional API key wiring and automated smoke checks.

Looking for a local-first workflow with refresh/troubleshooting steps? See `docs/runbooks/local-deployment.md`.

Auth is cookie-based and invite-gated — mint an invite via `docker compose exec backend python -m app.cli create-invite`, then sign up on `/signup`. The compose smoke test (`scripts/smoke_test.sh`) mints its own throwaway invite and signs up a temporary user automatically.

## Deployment

- **Fly.io**: Follow `docs/fly-deployment.md` for provisioning volumes, wiring secrets, deploying backend and frontend apps, and running curl smoke checks with rollback guidance.
- **Fly.io review apps**: See `docs/fly-review-apps.md` for frontend PR preview deploys and required GitHub secrets.
- **CI before deploys**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs backend lint/type/test + coverage, frontend unit tests + build, and Docker image builds on every push/PR to `main` and on `trunk-candidate/**` refs. Wait for CI to go green (see the badge above) before deploying to Fly.
- **Merge-queue landing**: every change, SHIP, SHOW or ASK, lands as a pull request through the merge queue. `Full CI` and `Docker Images` run on the PR head and again on the merge-group commit, and only a fully green group becomes `main`; no workflow holds `GITHUB_TOKEN` write. The successful `main` CI run triggers the default-branch release workflow: its `land` job proves `origin/main` equals the tested SHA, then its `deploy` job re-verifies that proof before any Fly mutation, runs the authenticated smoke (`scripts/production_smoke.sh`, asserting the `delivery_canary` flag for the internal smoke identity), and rolls back verified on failure. `FLY_API_TOKEN` and the smoke/cohort secrets live only in the GitHub `production` environment (custom `main`-only deployment branch policy; no repository-level `FLY_API_TOKEN`). ASK-class changes additionally need explicit recorded owner approval on the PR before they enter the queue. PR-less landing through `scripts/submit_to_trunk.sh` is retired. See `docs/decisions/0035-merge-queue-pr-landing.md`, `docs/decisions/0008-verified-trunk-serial-landing.md` and `docs/autonomous-delivery-runbook.md`.
## Fly.io Deployment (backend)

The backend Fly app is private and only reachable over Flycast from other apps in your organization (no public `fly.dev` address). Use `fly.backend.toml` to deploy the FastAPI service from `backend/Dockerfile` with health checks on `/health` and a volume mounted at `/app/data`.

```bash
# Create or resize the persistent volume
flyctl volumes create brain_buddy_data --size 1 --region iad

# Deploy using the backend config (session auth needs no extra secrets)
flyctl deploy -c fly.backend.toml
```

When pairing the private backend with the public frontend, point the frontend proxy at the Flycast address for your backend app (e.g., `http://<backend-app>.flycast:8000`) via `BACKEND_ORIGIN` in `fly.frontend.toml` or `flyctl secrets set BACKEND_ORIGIN=... -a <frontend-app>`.

## Environment & Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BRAIN_BUDDY_API_PREFIX` | `/api` | Route prefix for FastAPI routers |
| `BRAIN_BUDDY_DATA_DIR` | `<repo>/backend/data` | Root directory for data storage: tree JSON documents plus the task tracker's `tasks.sqlite3` |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `/api` | Frontend API base path (proxied in dev) |

See `docs/api_usage.md` for request/response details and examples.

## Testing & Tooling
- Backend: `cd backend && pytest`
- Frontend unit tests: `cd frontend && npm test`
- Spec Kit artifact check: `python3 scripts/check_spec_kit_specs.py` or `make check-specs`
- Linting/formatting: Black, Ruff, and Mypy on the backend; ESLint/Prettier via Vite on the frontend.
- Continuous improvement scripts live in the root `Makefile` (`make test-backend`, `make test-frontend`).
- **Coverage floors** are recorded per stack in `<stack>/coverage-floor.json` and may only ratchet upward (`scripts/validate_coverage_floor.py`). Source may not exclude itself from the measurement: `scripts/validate_ci_artifacts.py coverage-suppressions` rejects `istanbul ignore file` and every range form.
- **Mutation testing** runs nightly and report-only on both stacks — mutmut over the backend deterministic core (ADR-0004, ADR-0016) and Stryker over the frontend deterministic modules (ADR-0013): `make mutation-backend`, `make mutation-frontend`. Each stack keeps an *observed* scope it measures and a narrower *enforced* scope allowed to gate a pull request once calibrated; neither gate is connected yet.

## Feature Specs
GitHub Spec Kit v1.0.11 is mandatory when an ADR-0023 full-path trigger applies: a
significant new capability, cross-surface contract change, persistence/schema change,
materially changed workflow/state-machine boundary, or ASK-class outcome. Eligible
bounded SHIP/SHOW changes use ADR-0023's lightweight brief and one risk-selected
independent gate instead. Use
`docs/spec-kit-workflow.md` for the portable full authoring path, pinned commands, and
historical grandfathering rules. Outcomes explicitly enrolled in
the optional Hermes managed-delivery mode additionally follow ADR-0010 and
`docs/spec-driven-kanban.md`.

## Performance & Observability
- File-backed caches reduce repeated tree loads during read-heavy sessions.
- `useGraphProfiler` logs render timings in development once node/edge counts change.
- Every response includes `X-Correlation-ID`, making it easy to trace requests through backend logs.
- Error toasts now surface retry actions and show correlation references when failures occur.

## Documentation

- `docs/mcp.md` — GPT task tools and MCP connection setup.

Historical requirements, contracts, and the phased roadmap remain under `requirements/`.
